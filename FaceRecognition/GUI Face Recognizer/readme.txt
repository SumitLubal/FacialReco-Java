============================


This directory contains 2 Java files:
  *  FaceRecognizer.java, FaceRecogPanel.java

There is 1 image file, used by the application:
  *  crosshairs.png

There is 1 XML file, containing a Haar classifier for faces:
  *  haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml
         -- this was copied from the OpenCV directory: 
            <OpenCV>\data\haarcascades\

There is 1 subdirectory:
  *  lib\                -- holds the COLT package as a JAR
                           (from http://acs.lbl.gov/software/colt/)

There is 1 JAR file and 1 "cache" file
  *  JavaFaces2.jar    // this is a JAR file of the code in JavaFaces2\
  *  eigen.cache       // this is the Eigen information generated by JavaFaces2\
                       // this file will need to be updated if new Eigen info is created
                       // in javaFaces2\

There are 2 batch files:
  *  compile.bat
  *  run.bat
     - make sure they refer to the correct locations for your
       downloads of JavaCV and OpenCV


----------------------------
Before Compilation/Execution:

You need to have a webcam connected to your PC.

You need to download and install:

  * OpenCV:  I downloaded v2.4.5 for Windows with pre-compiled binaries:
             from http://opencv.org/downloads.html
             and installed it in C:\opencv

  * JavaCV:  http://code.google.com/p/javacv/
             I downloaded javacv-0.5-bin.zip
             and installed it in d:\javacv-bin
   
  * copy over JavaFaces2.jar and eigen.cache from the JavaFaces2\ example in this 
    download. If they are not there, then generate them by following the readme.txt
    instructions in that directory.


----------------------------
Compilation:

> compile *.java
    // you must have JavaCV, OpenCV, Colt and JavaFaces2.jar installed

----------------------------
Execution:

> run FaceRecognition
    // you must have JavaCV, OpenCV, Colt and JavaFaces2.jar installed
